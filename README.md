# Student Finances Application (Name TBD)

A tool for students to engage with their finances,
view analytics, and budget intuitively. 

## Why and Who?

I am not majoring in finance, but I am a fan of optimizing what little
money I have as a starving student. I have wished for answers to 
questions such as: 

- "where in the city should I shop for groceries to 
minimize my spending?"
- "Where am I most likely to buy things that I don't
need? What are they?"
- "How much should I put into savings each month? Invest?" or
- "How does my spending vary month to month?"

I believe that a lot of students have similar questions. I have seen 
others implement complex systems of Excel spreadsheets and forms, 
and countless hours of research. I doubt I am the only one whose questions
remain unaddressed due to ignorance, or simple apathy. This application
will offer insight into financial habits, provide systems to help 
optimize and implement budgeting, and eliminate unnecessary spending 
habits.

## What will this application do?

Suited to the needs of UBC Vancouver students like myself, this app will
make use of an intuitive data entry system that (locally) gathers information 
on one's personal finance. It will save basic data including time,
location, quantities of purchased goods, perceived utility, cost, and possibly 
more. The application will then allow the user access to an extensive set
of views of their financial situation, such that they may reflect, and
make informed decisions on their future purchases. Such views might
include where in the city they spend the most money? How prices of common
items vary across shops? It could possibly even generate strategic 
shopping lists suited to various sections of the city.

## Footnotes

**This is a note about why I chose this idea. Unrelated to P0 Task 2 on EdX.**
The development of this application will extend my foundation in 
Java, and offer me the opportunity to explore app development across numerous
data types and structures. There are lots of extensions to this idea that
I could plausibly develop based on what direction CPSC 210 steers me. It
will allow me to explore Java's graphical capabilities, including basic
menus and GUI, as well as visualizations. It is a straightforward idea,
meaning that my learning in this project is focused on implementing Java
and the tenets of object-oriented programming and design, not unrelated
matters (music theory, game design, to name a couple from my other
project ideas).
